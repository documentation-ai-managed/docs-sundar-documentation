## API Authentication

For API integrations, UXPin uses API keys and OAuth tokens:

<CodeGroup tabs="API Key,OAuth">
  ```javascript
const apiKey = 'uxp_your_api_key_here';
const response = await fetch('/api/projects', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
```
  ```javascript
const clientId = 'your_client_id';
const redirectUri = 'https://yourapp.com/callback';
// OAuth flow implementation
```
</CodeGroup>

<Callout kind="alert">Always store API keys securely and never commit them to version control.</Callout>

UXPin offers granular role-based access control:

| Role | Permissions | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Viewer | Read-only access | Stakeholders reviewing designs |
| Editor | Create and edit designs | Designers working on projects |
| Admin | Full workspace control | Team leads managing settings |
